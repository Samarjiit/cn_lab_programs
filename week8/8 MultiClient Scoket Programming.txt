1. Write a multi client-server chat socket program using TCP protocol to 
chat in infinite loop until client ends the chat session.

2. Write a multi client-server socket program using TCP. 
Client accepts an IP address and sends to server. 
Server receives IP address and displays it. Server process 
the IP address to identify the class of IP address (A, B, C, D, E). 
Server sends class and default mask to the client via socket. 
Client displays the result. 

3. Write a multi client-server socket program using TCP. 
Assume that Server has pre-stored information about five Account number, 
PIN and Balance. Client accepts account number, pin and withdrawal amount 
and sends to Server If account holder is valid then performs withdrawal 
operations provided enough balance is available otherwise display invalid 
Accno/PIN or No enough Balance. Assume that account can maintain 1000 balance.

4. Write a multi client-server socket program using TCP. 
Client accepts and sends coefficients (a, b, c) of a quadratic 
equation to server. Server calculates roots of quadratic equation 
and return roots to client. Client displays the roots of quadratic 
equation. Consider all possibilities of a,b,c values.
